# AGI-Project

project aims to develop an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system capable of understanding, learning, and applying knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level comparable to human intelligence. Our goal is to create a system that can perform any intellectual task that a human being can do, with the ability to learn and adapt.

Installation and Operating Instructions for AGI Project

Introduction

This document provides step-by-step instructions for installing and using the AGI Project.

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Natural Language Processing libraries (e.g., NLTK, SpaCy, Hugging Face Transformers)
- Computer Vision libraries (e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow)
- Reinforcement Learning libraries (e.g., OpenAI Gym)

Installation

Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open a terminal and run the following commands to clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AGI-Project.git
cd AGI-Project

Step 2: Install the Required Dependencies
Run the following command to install the necessary Python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Project

Step 1: Execute the Main Script
To run the main script, use the following command:

python src/main.py

This will initialize and run the core components of the AGI system, demonstrating their basic functionality.
