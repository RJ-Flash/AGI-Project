# AGI-Project
project aims to develop an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system capable of understanding, learning, and applying knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level comparable to human intelligence. Our goal is to create a system that can perform any intellectual task that a human being can do, with the ability to learn and adapt.
