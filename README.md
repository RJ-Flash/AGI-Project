# AGI-Project

The AGI project aims to develop an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system capable of understanding, learning, and applying knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level comparable to human intelligence. Our goal is to create a system that can perform any intellectual task that a human being can do, with the ability to learn and adapt.

Installation and Operating Instructions for AGI Project

Introduction

This document provides step-by-step instructions for installing and using the AGI Project.

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Natural Language Processing libraries (e.g., NLTK, SpaCy, Hugging Face Transformers)
- Computer Vision libraries (e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow)
- Reinforcement Learning libraries (e.g., OpenAI Gym)

Installation

Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open a terminal and run the following commands to clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/RJ-Flash/AGI-Project.git
cd AGI-Project

Step 2: Set up a virtual environment:
python -m venv agi-env
source agi-env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `agi-env\Scripts\activate`

Step 3: Install the Required Dependencies
Run the following command to install the necessary Python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4: Ensure Docker is installed:
Install Docker if not already installed.

Running the Project

Step 1: Execute the Main Script
To run the main script, use the following command:

python src/main.py

This will initialize and run the core components of the AGI system, demonstrating their basic functionality.

Running Tests

To run the tests for the project, use the following command:

python -m unittest discover tests

Step 2: Interact with the chat:

Use the train command with a file path or URL to load and train the supervised learning model and fine-tune the LLM with the provided data.
Use the download and docker commands as needed for model management.

Available commands:

 - ontology <concept> <description>: Add a concept to the ontology.
 - reason <premise>: Add a premise and perform reasoning.
 - train <file_path_or_url>: Train models with provided data.
 - download <model_command>: Download a model using a command.
 - docker <command>: Run a Docker command.
 - predict <data_point_1> <data_point_2> ...: Make predictions using the trained model.
 - understand <text>: Perform language understanding on provided text.
 - retrieve <query>: Retrieve documents based on the query.
 - generate <context>: Generate text based on the provided context.
 - /bye: Exit the chat.

{ Example Interaction:

Welcome to the AGI Project Interactive Chat!
You can interact with different components of the system.
Type '/bye' to exit the chat.
Type 'help' to see available commands.
